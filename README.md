# 🌦️ What to Wear Today, Kids? 👧🧒

A **weather app** designed to visually help kids understand the current weather before heading to kindergarten or grade school.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app aims to provide an intuitive and engaging way for young children, as well as individuals with cognitive disabilities, to grasp **real-time weather conditions** through animated visuals. 

- Uses **Geolocation** to fetch real-time weather data (requires user permission).
- **No data is stored** or collected; location permission is asked each time the website is opened.
- A displayed **kid character** will be dressed appropriately for the weather (raincoat, snowsuit, etc.).
- **Wind gust animations** increase in intensity based on the reported wind speed.
